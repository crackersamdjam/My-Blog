This year's [Canadian Computing Competition](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html#ccc) was held on February 12, 2020. Here I will dissect the results of the Senior Division contest.

*CCC 2019 (first image) vs CCC 2020 (second image) stats*

This year's S1 and S2 average scores were significantly lower than last year's. This is because the difficulty of these early problems has increased. S3 had a higher average score but a lower non-zero average score. I'm not sure what to make of this, but  know that the nature of this year's S3 is different. Last year's S3 tested the contestant's ability to come up with an "ad hoc" solution and then debug it. This is in contrast to this year's S3 which (straightforwardly) tested for knowledge of string algorithms. As seen in the non-zero scores, S4 and S5 were easier this year.

Due to an easier S4 and S5, the 2020 CCO cut-off is 57 and 25 contestants have been invited. In comparison, last year's cut-off was 48 and 31 were invited.

This year's Honour Roll cut-off of 37, down from last year's 39.
