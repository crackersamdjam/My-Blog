**Note:**  I wrote this blog a long time after the contest took place.

2020 was my first time at the Canadian Computing Olympiad (CCO). It normally runs for a week from Monday to Friday at the University of Waterloo. It was held online this year, which meant that I missed out on a lot of fun.

I had come out of the CCC with a nice lead of 15 points over most contestants. I believe that I had gotten lucky
