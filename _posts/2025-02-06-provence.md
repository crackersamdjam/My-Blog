It was the end of my exchange and I had wanted to visit Provence this whole time. As someone who loves nature, sunshine, and wants to explore more of France, it felt like the perfect destination. When I found out that flights in early December were incredibly cheap—only 60 CHF round trip to Nice—I couldn’t resist. None of my friends were interested, so I decided to embark on a solo adventure. The outgoing flight departed at 10h20, giving me plenty of time to travel from Lausanne to Geneva Airport. The return flight landed at 22h45, leaving me a safe buffer of time before the last train departed at midnight.

## Departure and Antibes (Dec 18)
I left for Geneva in the morning and grabbed breakfast at the train station. The flight was just an hour long, and the views of the clouds and the Alps were beautiful.

When we landed, it was a bit cloudy, but the warmth was much welcomed. I took a quick look at the free Asian Art Museum near the airport before catching a train to Antibes. I wandered through the old town and strolled along the rocky cape. With my heavy backpack, I didn't want to tire myself, so I frequently stopped to sit on the rocks and enjoy the fresh sea air.

As the sun set, I took the train to Marseille. French trains, while fast, were noticeably dirtier and wobblier compared to Swiss trains. No one seemed to mind the 20-minute delay, something that would have been unacceptable in Switzerland. I didn't mind either, on the scale a 2.5-hour journey. It’s said that when notoriously delayed Deutsche Bahn trains reach the Swiss border, they’re turned back to avoid disrupting Swiss network.

## Marseille (Dec 19)
The walk to my Airbnb in the old town wasn't particularly pleasant. While the area isn't as dangerous like the northern arrondissements of Marseille, it was still dirty, with narrow streets and steep hills. Tourist guides had described the old town as charming, but it felt more like a neglected residential district filled with the city's oldest and smallest apartments.

I had hoped to visit Château d’If the next day, but the ferry was closed for no apparent reason. Instead, I explored the port and visited the Plage des Catalans, another location featured in *The Count of Monte Cristo* 😉

![](port.jpg)

As I stepped out in the morning, I was immediately struck by the sight of the Basilica *Notre-Dame de la Garde* perched high on a hill, dominating the city skyline. I had never seen a structure command such a presence over a city—not in San Francisco, Barcelona, or even Rio de Janeiro. The climb was long, but the view from the top was worth every step.

On my way back down, I wandered through streets lined with tourist shops and stumbled upon a Christmas market. Unlike in Switzerland, the prices here were reasonable! I treated myself to mulled wine and tried a freshly baked chimney cake for the first time. The dough was soft and crispy. I also visited the Marseille History Museum, which, despite having few artifacts, did an excellent job of showcasing two millennia of history. What’s more, all the museums were free for European (not just EU) students! It makes me happy that attractions here don't charge foreigners exorbitant prices like in Istanbul or Barcelona.

My UNIL friend had left his windbreaker at his friend's place in Marseille, and I was tasked with bringing it back so he could use it for skiing. By now, it was dark, and the wind had picked up to 50 km/h. Walking along Prado Beach and through Borély Park, I could barely see anything, and the wind made it impossible to enjoy the night. I put on my friend’s windbreaker and immediately felt better. I’m glad he left it in Marseille for me to use 🙃

## Les Calanques (Dec 20)
The next day, I bussed to Cassis for a long day of hiking in the Calanques. I had originally planned a four-hour loop around Cassis, but upon reaching the halfway point, I decided it wasn't enough. I discovered I could hike all the way to Luminy and head home from there. It would take all day, but I had enough food and water—why not?

![](c1.jpg){: .w-75}
_Everything was so vast and beautiful!_

![](c2.jpg){: .w-50}

First, I had to climb out of a calanque. To avoid a long detour, I opted to take an unmarked trail up its side. The 180-meter climb was exhausting, and I found myself on all fours. I slipped twice and had to stop multiple times to catch my breath. With no safe way to descend, the only option was to keep climbing.

![](up.png){: .w-50}
_Zooming in, you'll see that this was hardly a path._

I thought the worst was over, but for most of the remaining hike, I was exposed to the Mistral winds. Contrary to the forecast, the winds grew stronger throughout the day. I kid you not—the average wind speed during my hike was 73km/h, with even fiercer gusts. On narrow rocky paths along ridges and mountainsides, I had to drop to the ground every few minutes to avoid being blown off. Thank goodness for my friend’s windbreaker!

_Starting to worry I wouldn’t make it before dark._

I started the hike at 09h30 with what I thought was enough food for the day, planning to grab an evening snack back in Marseille. However, the cold and intense physical exertion meant I burned through all my food by 13h30. I rushed to reach Luminy before sunset and temperatures dropped further. Luckily, I reached a paved road by 16h00 and arrived at 17h00, just as the sun set. Cold and hungry, I looked forward to a massive kebab waiting for me in Marseille.

![](strava.png){: .w-50}

This was the most challenging hike I’ve ever done, both in terms of terrain (the climb out of the calanque) and physical stress from the relentless winds and unstable pebbles. The only thing that could have made it worse was if I had to carry a drunkard down the mountain 😆. Despite the exhaustion, I woke up early the next day feeling refreshed and ready to take an early morning train to Toulon.

## Toulon (Dec 21)
I arrived an hour before the Naval Museum opened. Not wanting to tire myself out by walking with my full backpack, I took a ferry across Toulon’s harbor. When the driver asked where I was heading, I explained I was staying on the boat to loop around the harbor. For the price of a standard metro ticket, I got the full tourist harbour experience.

The naval museum was small, and I guess there wasn’t much to showcase about the French navy. Unfortunately, they couldn’t hold on to my backpack after I left, so I had to carry it around all day. The farmer's market was huge! Half the stalls sold produce, a quarter sold hot food, and the rest sold clothing—no overpriced Christmas market stands here 🐷. I tried fried zucchini balls and paella for lunch. The zucchini balls were delicious but the paella was disappointing. I had expecgted more for six Euros.

![](market1.jpg){: .w-75}

I then took a bus up the foothills of Mont Faron. The paved road up was long and winding, but I found a rocky trail that led straight to the top. It was a rather steep 350-metre ascent over 1500m where my backpack destroyed me. I took a long rest at the panoramic viewpoint.

![](faron1.jpg){: .w-75}
![](faron2.jpg){: .w-75}
![](faron3.jpg){: .w-75}

To avoid the long winding road back, I had to take the same trail down, which was just as difficult. Still hot from the hike, I tasted gelato for the first time. The server patiently answered all my inqueries in French about the flavours.

## Arrival in Nice (Dec 21)
Everyone in Toulon (and Marseille) had been so accommodating, patiently speaking French in our interactions. I was pleasantly surprised, and the contrast was stark when I arrived in Nice that evening. At the first two restaurants I entered, the waiters responded rudly in English, "no, full," without replying to my "bon soir." The third restaurant had space, but after being told to sit anywhere, I was ignored. The waiters were fooling around, so I walked out. I have no idea why so many Chinese tourists would eat in that restaurant with such bad service.

Thankfully, the rest of my experience in Nice was good. I found a place with good service to eat and write in peace. After dinner, I visited the Christmas market for some mulled wine. The Nice Christmas market was large and lively, comparable to Montreux but without the inflated costs. As I walked by, a girl called out, "Pardon, monsieur," and I turned around. She paused and said in English "could you..." and handed me her phone with the camera app open.

> “Prendre une photo de vous trois?”

> “Yes, can you do like...” she gestured to rotate the camera.

I turned it vertically.

> “Comme ça?”

> “Yes.”

By now, her friends were laughing that she hadn't processed I was talking to her in French. They pointed it out and we had a good laugh.

## Nice (Dec 22)
Still tired from the previous day from carrying my backpack everywhere, I started the day slow. I walked along the boardwalk to the farmer's market, where I got to try Socca and bought a vanilla flan for just 2.5 Euros. Vanilla flan has become my favourite dessert in Europe—it's not overly sweet but rich and creamy. Socca, a local specialty made from chickpeas, had a nice texture: crunchy on the outside and sticky on the inside, though it lacked flavour.

![](socca.jpg){: .w-50}

I headed up the hill for a viewpoint and discovered a beautiful cemetery. Once again, I saw "died for the fatherland" engraved on many tombstones.

_Wasn't expecting to see you again_

After a quick lunch, I returned to my accommodation for a midday nap. Later, I visited the Masséna Museum. The first thought that came to mind was the only Masséna I know: André Masséna, marshal of France 😉. To my surprise, it's indeed named after him! The museum, housed in his grandson's villa, was filled with royal decor, portraits, and paintings of battles. I loved this mini palace of Versailles.

At the ticket counter, the lady asked for my department. When I explained I lived in Switzerland and was from Canada, she repeated, "Canada," with a suspicious look. I wonder what she was thinking.

![](m1.jpg){: .w-50}

![](m3.jpg){: .w-75}

My next stop was the Russian Orthodox Cathedral. It turns out the Russian Baltic fleet once leased a nearby port, leading to a Russian diaspora in the area. I loved seeing the familiar Eastern Orthodox and Tsarist artifacts in the basilica and basement museum—it reminded me of old high school friends back in Canada 😌

![](ru1.jpg){: .w-50}
![](ru2.jpg){: .w-50}
![](ru3.jpg){: .w-50}

The highlight of my day, however, was dinner at a Lebanese kebab restaurant. The waitress, chef, and waiter/DJ were all incredibly friendly. Unlike the food workers I encountered the previous day in Nice, they smiled and returned my "bon soir." I was about to walk past this place as there were only two others in the restaurant, but the food looked so good that I had to stay. The kebab plate was delicious. While I waited, the DJ-waiter struck up a conversation in English. After I paid, I returned to my table to write my travel journal. The waitress brought me mint tea and asked what I was writing—perhaps she thought I was a food reviewer? She came back once more with sweets and this time I had to protest.

![](kebab.jpg){: .w-50}
_Finally, some flavorful food_

I then headed to the shore to check out the souvenir shops. As an old lady was closing up her stand, an old man passing by asked if she'd be open until midnight. She sarcastically replied, "half past midnight!"—how bizarre 🙃. 

## Èze and Monaco (Dec 23)
I took the train to a small seaside stop and hiked up the Chemin du Nietzsche[^nietzsche] to reach the hilltop town of Èze. At the top was an exotic garden that charged a five Euro entrance fee. While the garden itself was unremarkable, it offered stunning views from the peak. The garden was just their excuse to charge a fee.

![](nietzsche.jpg){: .w-50}
![](eze.jpg){: .w-50}
_The top of Èze_

A bus was supposed to come through the village four times a day, but when it didn’t show up, I heard people talking (in Chinese and American English, lol) of ridesharing. The Indian-American couple beside me booking an Uber to Monaco and I asked how much it was. They invited me to share the rideshare, and we had a fun ride together. On the car, I asked the guy how I should pay him. To his surprise, I happened to have a single 20 USD bill on me and he had 10 USD for change. I would have otherwise offred him my coins in various currencies: Swiss Francs, Turkish Lira, Romanian Leu, and Canadian Dollars.

Monaco was incredibly wealthy and pristine. Clean, free public toilets were everywhere! I had anticipated the food would be expensive—twice the price of Nice—so I brought supermarket sandwiches with me. I spent a few hours walking across the whole country and chilling.

![](monaco1.jpg){: .w-50}
![](monaco2.jpg){: .w-50}
![](monaco3.jpg){: .w-50}

I returned to my lodging, showered, ate a kebab, and headed to the airport.

### The Return Flight

EasyJet Switzerland packs flights back to back, all of them starting or ending at Geneva. It was snowy in Geneva this day, so the flight accumulated more and more delay. My flight scheduled for 21h45–22h45 was pushed back to 23h30–00h30, 30 minutes after the last train left Geneva Airport.

At the gate, the man sitting next to me asked an EasyJet staff member what to do when he landed after the last train left. She said to ask customer service in Geneva. Since he and his girlfriend were heading to Neuchâtel, I offered to split a cab, as Renens was on the way—I didn’t want to pay 150 CHF for a solo ride home. He said to wait and see what happened when we landed. I, knowing Easyjet, knew we wouldn't get any help.

Geneva Airport was dead quiet. The two said they'd wait until the next morning train, so that's what I did too.

I found a dark place to sleep on the floor near others.  To my surprise, I fell asleep for an hour before the noise of the airport getting busy at 3h30 woke me up. I lay on my back for another hour, my hip aching from sleeping sideways. I caught the 05h00 train and slept soundly until my alarm woke me for my stop. I reached home at 6h20 and collapsed into bed. When I woke up around 11, I felt surprisingly normal, aside from my sore hip. In the future, I'm paying extra for an earlier return flight to GVA in winter, when there's a chance of "bad" weather—it wasn't even that bad; these people can't handle any snow 🙄

## Le Fin

I spoke almost exclusively French during this trip! I hadn't planned to, but it felt natural after doing so in Switzerland. Unlike other places I've traveled, Southern France was full of immigrants. Whenever I ordered food and heard the staff speaking a foreign language, I’d ask where they were from. The chimney cake stand was run by Guyanese, the kebab shop by Algerians, and there's the Lebanese restaurant.

I left feeling replenished by the sun and the sea. I should come here to recharge every year like Nietzsche did 😌
