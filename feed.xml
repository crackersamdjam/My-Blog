If you take a look closely at the sample input, you might figure that the 2 means that there are two test cases and each case is a 28x28 grid of floats. The answers to the cases are 1 and 5 respectively. Now you might think of visualizing these grids: import matp... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Comparing 2N and 4N-sized recursive segment trees</title><link href="https://ericpei.ca/posts/segment-tree/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Comparing 2N and 4N-sized recursive segment trees" /><published>2021-07-08T10:32:48-04:00</published> <updated>2021-07-08T15:40:43-04:00</updated> <id>https://ericpei.ca/posts/segment-tree/</id> <content src="https://ericpei.ca/posts/segment-tree/" /> <author> <name>Eric Pei</name> </author> <category term="Competitive Programming" /> <summary> Introduction When you implement a recursive segment tree, it’s better to store segment tree nodes in an array or vector than it is to create a new object for every node one by one. This reduces the time it takes to create the nodes and it improves caching since the nodes are in a contiguous chunk of memory. 4N implementation If you have vector&amp;lt;node&amp;gt; nodes, you might make nodes[1] the r... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>My (ICPC) Codebook</title><link href="https://ericpei.ca/posts/codebook/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My (ICPC) Codebook" /><published>2021-07-05T17:43:22-04:00</published> <updated>2021-07-05T17:43:22-04:00</updated> <id>https://ericpei.ca/posts/codebook/</id> <content src="https://ericpei.ca/posts/codebook/" /> <author> <name>Eric Pei</name> </author> <category term="Competitive Programming" /> <summary> In the ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest), each team is allowed to bring up to 25 pages of printed material. There are many great codebooks out there such as KACTL, but I prefer to write templates by myself. I am currently using verification-helper to manage my codebook. What makes verification-helper so useful is that it lets you create tests for your templates, which get run ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>CCO 2020</title><link href="https://ericpei.ca/posts/cco-2020/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CCO 2020" /><published>2021-07-04T11:56:10-04:00</published> <updated>2021-08-26T14:22:17-04:00</updated> <id>https://ericpei.ca/posts/cco-2020/</id> <content src="https://ericpei.ca/posts/cco-2020/" /> <author> <name>Eric Pei</name> </author> <category term="Contests" /> <summary> My Experience Note: I am writing this blog in June 2021, after the 2021 (not 2020) CCO. 2020 was my first time at the Canadian Computing Olympiad (CCO).
